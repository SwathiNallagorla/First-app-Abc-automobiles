A diagnostic is performed to identify any electrical components reporting a failure or a part operating outside of normal conditions.
Replacement - Given certain lubricants break down over time due to heat and wear, manufacturers recommend replacement. Any parts that are close to their expected failure are replaced too to avoid a failure while operating the vehicle.
Adjustments - as vehicle components wear, they may need adjustment over time. Example: parking brake cable.

the number of trips and distance traveled per trip per day
extreme hot or cold climate conditions
mountainous, dusty, or DE-iced roads
heavy stop-and-go vs. long-distance cruising
towing a trailer or other heavy load</p></div>

                <div className="col-md-6"><p>A motor vehicle service or tune-up is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has traveled a certain distance. The service intervals are specified by the vehicle manufacturer in a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel. A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, which is the modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification, rather than using maintenance to keep the engine running as it should.</p></div>
